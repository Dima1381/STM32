[Topic] :  Blinking code with LED. 

[Idea]: The program consists of flashing an LED on a target. 
The LED flashes a randomly generated code consisting of 5 values ​​(from 0 to 10).

I will go through all the steps from starting the STM32CubeIDE to compiling the program on the target.

Here you can find 3 files: 
	Description.docx
	Flashing led code.zip
	Result.mp4

<Description.docx> - Step-by-step description of project development.
<Flashing led code.zip> - The project.
<Result.mp4> - Video of the project working. In the video you can see that Led blinking code [48323].
